    "## Problem 2: Automatic Detection and Correction of Fused Mathematical Expressions [3 Points]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fused Mathematical Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been hired by MathCorrector, a company specializing in developing tools to automatically detect and correct specific errors in mathematical expressions. This task focuses on errors where multiplication operators between numbers and variables are missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance\n",
    "- `2x + 5y` should be converted to `2 * x + 5 * y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling of Special Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also required to handle specific mathematical constants and symbols that should not be split or modified. To simplify the task, you are only required to handle the following four specific mathematical constants and symbols. These symbols are:\n",
    "- `pi` (Pi)\n",
    "- `phi` (The golden ratio)\n",
    "- `theta` (Angle in trigonometry)\n",
    "- `gamma` (Euler-Mascheroni constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- `2pi` should be `2 * pi`, not `2 * p * i`\n",
    "- `3theta` should remain `3 * theta`, not `3 * t * h * e * t * a`\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, the input will only contaion varialbes(**consisting of a single letter**), numbers, the four specific symbols listed above, and basic arithmetic operators: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and equal (`=`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the expression easier to read, you are also required to format the expression to ensure consistent spacing between operators and operands. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "- `2*x+ 5*y` should be `2 * x + 5 * y`\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can assume that the input expression is correct except for the problems mentioned above.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Three functions are desiged to handle problmes metioned above. In this problem, you will implement theses three functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **detect_fused_tokens(expr)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Detect where multiplication is missing between numbers and variables, ignoring the predefined constants.\n",
    "   - **Input**: A string `expr` representing the mathematical expression.\n",
    "   - **Process**: Identify places where numbers are directly followed by variables without an operator (such as `2x`), ensuring predefined constants like `pi` and `phi` are ignored.\n",
    "   - **Output**: Return a list of locations in the expression where multiplication is missing (as indices or substrings that need fixing).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **insert_multiplication(expr, fused_tokens)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Insert multiplication operators in the correct positions identified by the `detect_fused_tokens` function.\n",
    "   - **Input**: A string `expr` representing the mathematical expression, and a list `fused_tokens` from the `detect_fused_tokens` function.\n",
    "   - **Process**: Add multiplication operators between numbers and variables in the locations identified by the `fused_tokens`.\n",
    "   - **Output**: Return the modified expression with the appropriate multiplication operators inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **format_expression(expr)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Format the expression to ensure consistent spacing between operators and operands, making the expression easier to read.\n",
    "   - **Input**: The expression processed by the `insert_multiplication` function.\n",
    "   - **Process**: Ensure appropriate spacing between all operators and operands.\n",
    "   - **Output**: Return the formatted mathematical expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input `2x+ 5y - 3zw + 2pi`:\n",
    "- The `detect_fused_tokens` function will detect the missing multiplication operators and return relevant information (e.g., `['2x', '5y', '3zw']`).\n",
    "- The `insert_multiplication` function will process the expression and convert it to `2*x+ 5*y - 3*z*w + 2pi`.\n",
    "- The `format_expression` function will ensure consistent spacing and convert it to `2 * x + 5 * y - 3 * z * w + 2pi`.\n",
