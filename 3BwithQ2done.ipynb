TomTom stores top-down 2D views of a city in a 2D Numpy array. An example layout for a city is shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this map, locations marked with ‘1’ represents empty-spaces whereas ‘0’ represent buildings. Your task is to code a solution that computes a driving route via empty spaces from one end of the city to the other subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drivers always start from an empty-space in the extreme left column (```city_map[:,0]```) and always terminate their journey in the column on the extreme right (```city_map[:,-1]```).\n",

    "\n",
    "To get started, follow these steps:\n",

    "1. Given a city map, mark locations directly above, below, left and right of a building as blocked (remember, they are parking locations for the building and cannot be used for the route). Save this transformed map in a second map called\n",
    "```marked_city_map```.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you have a ```marked_city_map```, you will start from a location in the left-most column. Before moving into a new location, you must check if it is blocked (note that you cannot stand at a location of a building or parking). Once you move into an unblocked spot, you can then look again in four possible directions (up, down, left, right) to see if you can move there.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You must implement the above procedure using a **recursive** function that takes a step in all unblocked directions and checks if it can then repeat this again. It recursively repeats this till it reaches the final column.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can break this into the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [1 point] Write a function ```mark_parking_locations()``` takes a 2D Numpy array ```city_map``` as an argument and converts it to a ```marked_city_map``` by marking all parking locations. You should mark parking locations with -1 in your Numpy array.\n",
