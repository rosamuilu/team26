    "# Algorithms and Data Structures in Python â€” Assignment III (Part One)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following assignment will test your understanding of topics covered in the first four weeks of the course. This assignment will count towards your grade and should be submitted through Canvas by 03.10.2023 at 23:59 (CEST). You are required to work and prepare your submissions in groups with 3 students per group. You can get at most **5 points for Assignment III (Part One)**, which is 5\\% of your final grade. Assignment III (Part Two) will be released next week. Please submit your notebooks for Assignment III (Part One) and (Part Two) together.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For submission, please rename your notebook as ```group_{i}_assignment2.ipynb```. For example, submission by group 1 should have the filename ```group_1_assignment2.ipynb```.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Please follow the function prototype specified in the question for writing your code. The usage of additional functions is acceptable unless the problem expressly prohibits it. If this structure is modified, it will fail automated testing steps\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Do **not** externally modify the CSV data file accompanying this assignment.\n",

    "### Problem 1 : Loading CSV Data (1 point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with how to load data. In this problem, you will load the ```enron_employees.csv``` file provided with this assignment. (A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a text file that contains data 'delimited' by a character into separate values. When read by a program, these files can be easily converted into simple spreadsheets and can be read and edited by popular spreadsheet processing programs like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. Since CSV files are simple to load and do not require specialized commercial software for usage, they are extremely popular as a data-distribution format.)\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: When row numbers are mentioned below, they start from 1 as you would generally see in spreadsheet software like Calc or Excel. Please do not forget that Python uses zero-based indexing (indices start from 0 instead of 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use the csv library to load CSV files. The code for reading a csv file using the csv library is as follows.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('path/to/your/file', 'r', encoding=\"utf8\") as rf:\n",
    "\treader = csv.reader(rf, delimiter = ',')\n",
    "\tfor row in reader:\n",
    "\t\tprint(row) # row represents a single row of data from the CSV file. csv.reader reads the file line by line, and each row is stored as a list where each element corresponds to a cell in that row.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " In this problem, you will implement a function named ```load_data(filepath)``` that first read the provided csv file and return the header and data. Header is a first row of the csv file and data contains everything from row 2 onwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the function will be called by ```load_data('path/to/your/file')```. The header and data should be return in the format of two lists, i.e., ```['from', 'to', 'timestamp'], [['48', '13', '926389620'], ['67', '13', '926418960'], ['67', '13', '926418960'], ['75', '147', '926430480'], ['67', '48', '926498640']]```."
