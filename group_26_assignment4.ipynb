    "The following assignment will test your understanding of topics covered in the first five weeks of the course. This assignment **will count towards your grade** and should be submitted through Canvas by **10.10.2024 at 23:59 (CEST)**. You are required to work and prepare your submissions in groups with 3 students per group. You can get at most 10 points for Assignment 4, which is 10\\% of your final grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For submission, please rename your notebook as ```group_{i}_assignment4.ipynb```. For example, submission by group 1 should have the filename ```group_1_assignment4.ipynb```.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Please follow the function prototype specified in the question for writing your code. The usage of additional functions is acceptable unless the problem expressly prohibits it. If this structure is modified, it will fail automated testing steps.\n",

    "3. All submissions will be checked for code similarity. Submissions with high similarity will be summarily rejected and no points will be awarded.\n",

    "Travel agents work with various planning applications to get real-time travel information to serve their clients. In this assignment, you will build a complete product that will offer travel agents the ability to add, delete and update railway travel information for several railway stations in the country (Netherlands), while still being able to view complex connections with a single command. You will be storing this information in a graph. A graph is composed of nodes (vertices) connected with edges. The nodes in our problem are railway stations, while the edges are railway connections between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will write two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The ```RailwayStation``` class stores attributes commonly associated with railway stations (e.g. railway station name, railway station code, inbound and outbound connections) in a single place.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The ```RailwayNetwork``` class  stores connections between these stations and provides an interface for travel agents to work with ```RailwayStation``` objects and build their own travel networks.\n",

    "The ```RailwayStation``` class stores information associated with a railway station. This class must define the following attributes:\n",

    "1. ```railway_station_name``` should accept the railway station name and save it within an instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

Information about railway stations names and their respective codes (for railway stations in the Netherlands) can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_stations_in_the_Netherlands) (in the **List of stations, with their official abbreviations** section). Write an appropriate setter method to ensure that the supplied railway station code complies with the general structure of a station code (string without numerical information, 3-4 characters long).\n",

Remember that railway station codes are always unique and an agent should not be allowed to add two RailwayStation objects with the same railway station code into a network. You are also asked to set the built-in class methods ```__init__``` and ```__str__``` properly so that the objects are properly initialized and their str() representations provide readable, well-formatted string representations.\n",

You will accept railway station codes for source and destination and raise appropriate errors if the user tries to overwrite existing routes. This function will also update the inbound and outbound connection attributes for the source and destination RailwayStation objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ```def modify_route_price(self, src_railway_station_code, dst_railway_station_code, new_ticket_price)``` which should modify the price of an existing route from the source railway station to the destination railway station. You will accept railway station codes for source and destination and raise appropriate errors if the user tries to modify non-existent routes or supply invalid data.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. ```def get_network_graph(self)``` uses information about nodes and their outbound connections for all RailwayStation objects in the Network instance to build a graphical representation of connectivity. You can look up https://python-graph-gallery.com/ on how to build these graphs. \n",
